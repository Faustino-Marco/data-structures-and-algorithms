Binary Tree and BST Implementation

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Binary Tree
- Create a Binary Tree class
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
    - Define method for each order
  - Pre-Order
    - Root - left - right
  - In order
    - left - root - right
  - Post Order
    - left - right - root

### Binary Search Tree
- Create a Binary Search Tree class
  - This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
  - Add
    - Arguments: value
    - Return: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - Contains
    - Argument: value
    - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
