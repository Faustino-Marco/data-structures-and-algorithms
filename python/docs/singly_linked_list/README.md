## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Began with starter code
- created classes to pass tests
  - built out code step by step with tests
- Big O
  - inserting new node at head is O(1)
  - searching for a certain value at each node is O(N)
