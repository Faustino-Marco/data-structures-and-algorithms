# Tree Breadth First
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Traverse the Tree and output the content of the tree using a Breadth-first traversal/walkthrough

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Write a function called breadth first
  - Arguments: tree
  - Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
### Space
O(N) - Storing as many nodes's values as there are nodes in the tree
### Time
O(N) - Hitting each node and operating on it once
